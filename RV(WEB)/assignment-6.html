            <ins><i><b>Airbrush</b></i></ins>
            <p>Airbrush makeup is makeup sprayed onto the skin using an airbrush machine instead of being applied with sponges,
                 brushes, fingers, or other methods. A typical airbrush system uses a compressor to create airflow through a hose 
                 connected to a trigger-controlled spray painting gun. The airbrush pressure can be adjusted to apply various types of 
                 makeup, such as lighter, heavier, or more detailed styles. Airbrushes are used in film, theater, bridal makeup, and 
                 sunless tanning. Airbrush systems designed for personal, in-home use are usually smaller and work at a lower pressure 
                 than systems used in professional applications.</p><br>

                 <em><strong><u>Concealer</u></strong></em>
                 <p>Concealer is a type of cosmetic that is used to mask imperfections on the skin. These imperfections can 
                    include dark circles under the eyes, blemishes, and hyperpigmentation. Concealer is similar to, and can 
                    be used in conjunction with foundation, a lighter cosmetic that is used to even out the skin tone. Both 
                    concealer and foundation are typically used to make skin appear smoother and more uniform in color. These 
                    two types of cosmetics differ in that concealers tend to be more heavily pigmented, though concealer and 
                    foundation are both available in a wide range of colors and opacities.</p><br>

                 <i><b><ins>Highlighter</ins></b></i>
                 <p>Highlighter is a type of cosmetic product that reflects light. Often used for contouring, it can be 
                    applied to the face or other parts of the body to brighten the skin on a given area, create the perception 
                    of depth and angles. The product can come in a variety of forms, including powder, liquid, cream,
                    gloss, solid stick and jelly. Highlighters are different from illuminators.Highlighters became a 
                    significant tool among theater and film actors shooting or performing indoors, where natural light was not 
                    available to define facial features like cheekbones, nose, and jawline. Highlighter also offers the 
                    possibility of heightening or diminishing a given feature to suit the character portrayed, as well as 
                    aesthetic trends.</p><br>

                    <p>Lipstick is a cosmetic product used to apply coloration and texture to lips, often made of wax
                         and oil. Different pigments are used to produce color, and minerals such as silica may be used to
                          provide texture. The use of lipstick dates back to early civilizations such as Sumer and the Indus 
                          Valley Civilisation, and was popularized in the Western world in the 16th century. Some lipsticks 
                          contain traces of toxic materials, such as lead and PFAS, which prompted health concerns and 
                          regulation.Lipstick has been prominent in several women's fashion trends, often associated 
                          with women's sexuality. The color of lipstick has aesthetic and cultural significance, as different 
                          colors carry different connotations. Red lipstick has historically been associated with sensuality 
                          or women's independence, while black lipstick is worn by both men and women in alternative subcultures, 
                          especially punk and goth. Celebrities such as Marilyn Monroe, Elizabeth Taylor, Madonna, and Taylor Swift 
                          have contributed to the popularity and iconic images of lipstick in fashion and mainstream media.</p>
