        <b><u>My first blog</u> :-</b>
        <br>
        Hi guys, Welcome to my very new blog. Please forgive for any mistakes I would have done here :).
        <p>
            Ok guys, You know today I'm going to tell what I leart in today's WEB class.
            <br>today I learnt about types of lists. There are three types of lists available,<br>
            Those are<br>
            <ol type="I">
                <li>ORDERED LIST</li>
                <li>UNORDERED LIST</li>
                <li>DESCRIPTIVE LIST</li>
            </ol>
        </p>
        <br>So now let's get to know about all three types of list as I have mentioned.
        <hr>
        <br><b><u>ORDERED LIST</u></b>
        <hr size="5" color="green" width="12%" align="left">
        In this type of list it is mainly used for numdered list, such as
        Roman numbers(both lowercase and uppercase),Numbers, Alphabets(both lowercase and uppercase).
        <br>
        <b><u>UNORDERED LIST</u></b>
        <hr align="left" color="green" width="12%" size="5">
        This is just an oppasite type of ordereed list, because here we can't use any type of numders.
        types of this list are circle, disc ,square.<br>
        <b><u>DESCRIPTIVE LIST</u></b>
        <hr align="left" color="green" width="12%" size="5">
        In this type of list there is no need worry type of list because there here we don't have types.
        <br>But instead we have different tags inside this list.such as,<br>
        (dl) -it contains the body of the lists<br>
        (dt) -it indicates the heading<br>
        (dd) -it cantains the description of the heading<br>
        <br>
        About the <b>list </b>was my first topic,and the second toopic is about <b>link</b>
        <br>
        In today's class I jave just leared about link,and it's tag,i.e,<b>(a)</b>
        <br><br>
        So this was all about what I have learned in today's class.If you need any examples of these topics
        then follow the link.<br><hr>
