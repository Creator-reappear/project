    <p style="margin-top:70px;margin-left:70px; margin-right:70px; margin-bottom:70px;">Stake in Success: If you make a better coffee machine, the company sells more coffee machines, and the value of your stake grows. If your (longterm) pay is
     directly tied to the quality of your work, you focus more on project work and less on politics.
    Salary Growth: If every promotion comes with a 50 percent increase in salary, you would be spending most of your day making sure every influential person knows 
    exactly who you are, how good your work is, and how bad everyone else’s work is. If, however, promotions come with a 5 percent increase in pay, who cares!
    Management Levels: If a 1,000-people company has only three levels of management hierarchy, promotions will happen so rarely that it won’t be worth spending 
    any time politicking. If there are 10 levels, however, the career ladder may always be on your mind.
    Project-Skill Fit: The greater your skill on the projects you’ve been assigned, the likely you are to choose project work. The lower your       project–skill fit, 
    the likely you are to choose politics.
    A company that finds a good balance between these forces is likely to have a very low RoP and focus on innovation instead of franchises.</p>
